    "\n",
    "**sparqlx** is a Python library for SPARQL 1.2 Protocol operations built on httpx. Key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Usage:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sparqlx import SPARQLWrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "wrapper = SPARQLWrapper(sparql_endpoint=\"https://query.wikidata.org/bigdata/namespace/wdq/sparql\")\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Async support**: `aquery()` for async queries\n",
    "- **Concurrent queries**: `queries()` runs multiple queries concurrently from sync code\n",
    "- **Streaming**: `query_stream()` / `aquery_stream()` for large result sets\n",
    "- **RDFLib integration**: Set `convert=True` to get Python dicts with RDFLib objects for SELECT, bool for ASK, or `rdflib.Graph` for CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE\n",
    "- **Context managers**: Connection pooling within context\n",
    "- **Update operations**: `update()`, `aupdate()`, `updates()` for SPARQL Update\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response Formats:**\n",
    "- SELECT/ASK: json, xml, csv, tsv\n",
    "- CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE: turtle, xml, ntriples, json-ld\n",
    "\n",
    "**Client Configuration:**\n",
    "- Pass your own `httpx.Client` or use `client_config={\"timeout\": 10.0}` \n",
    "- For async, use `aclient` or `aclient_config`\n",

    "- `rlm_system_prompt()` - builds the system prompt with chunking strategies and tool descriptions\n",
    "- `make_chunk_tool()` / `make_llm_tool()` - factory functions for tools\n",
    "- `REPLResult`, `CodeBlock`, `RLMIteration` - dataclasses for iteration tracking\n",
    "- `find_code_blocks()` - parse repl code blocks using mistletoe\n",
    "- `exec_code()` - execute code in namespace, capture stdout/stderr\n",
    "- `rlm_run()` - full loop for deployed apps\n",
    "- `rlm_step()` - single iteration for interactive solveit use\n",

    "**From rlmpaper:**\n",
    "1. **`QueryMetadata`** - Just tracks `context_lengths`, `context_total_length`, `context_type` for the system prompt metadata\n",
    "2. **`context` variable** - The actual data is stored in the REPL namespace as `context`, not chunked by RLM itself\n",
    "3. **LLM does the chunking** - The LLM decides how to chunk and iterate through `context` using `llm_query` / `llm_query_batched`\n",
    "4. **`FINAL(answer)` or `FINAL_VAR(varname)`** - How the LLM signals completion\n",
    "\n",
    "**For a SPARQL tool, the pattern would be:**\n",
    "- `sparql_query()` executes the query and stores results in namespace (like `res`)\n",
    "- Returns a summary (result count, types, sample) so the LLM knows what it got\n",
    "- The LLM can then inspect/chunk `res` itself using REPL code\n",
    "- For large results, the LLM can use `llm_query` to analyze chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "So the tool doesn't need to do chunking - it just stores results and returns metadata. The LLM handles iteration.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Key RLM principles:**\n",
    "1. **Context lives in namespace** - The `context` variable is loaded into the REPL, the LLM explores it via code\n",
    "2. **LLM drives chunking** - The LLM decides how to chunk/iterate based on the data structure\n",
    "3. **`llm_query` / `llm_query_batched`** - Sub-LLM calls for semantic analysis of chunks\n",
    "4. **Metadata in system prompt** - Just tell the LLM the total chars, chunk lengths, and type\n",
    "5. **Tools enrich the namespace** - A SPARQL tool should just add results to the namespace and return summary metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "**For SPARQL, the RLM-native approach would be:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sparql_query(query, endpoint) → stores result in `context` (or named var)\n",
    "                              → returns metadata (type, size, sample)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the LLM:\n",
    "- Inspects `context` (Graph or list of bindings)\n",
    "- For Graphs: `for s,p,o in context`, or `context.serialize(format='turtle')`\n",
    "- For SELECT: `context[:10]`, iterate rows\n",
    "- Uses `llm_query()` to analyze chunks semantically\n",

    "Good, I can see the differences. Key things from the old `swtools.py` that we should consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reproduced:**\n",
    "- ✅ Query execution with endpoint parameter\n",
    "- ✅ max_results limiting\n",
    "- ✅ Store in namespace with custom name\n",
    "- ✅ SELECT vs CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE handling\n",
    "- ✅ Returns summary with count\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences:**\n",
    "1. **Default endpoint** - old uses DBpedia, ours uses Wikidata\n",
    "2. **Docstring** - old has extensive guidance about prefixes, label service, query strategies\n",
    "3. **Graph results** - old converts to `list[tuple[str,str,str]]`, ours keeps as `rdflib.Graph`\n",
    "4. **SELECT results** - old keeps raw JSON bindings, ours uses rdflib-converted objects\n",
    "\n",
    "The main functional difference is our version uses `sparqlx` with `convert=True` which gives rdflib objects, while the old one keeps raw JSON. The docstring guidance is quite valuable for the LLM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Should we:\n",
    "1. Add the detailed docstring from the old version?\n",
    "2. Change the default endpoint to DBpedia?\n",
    "3. Keep Graph results as rdflib.Graph (more powerful) or convert to tuples (simpler)?"
