    "4. **Convergence**: Is the sample size (k rollouts) sufficient?\n",

    "- ✓ All 78 tests passing (44 functionality + 30 mathematical correctness + 4 integration)\n",

    "### Problem: Temperature Alone Is Insufficient\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discovery from smoke tests:** For simple tasks, `temperature=0.7` produces identical trajectories because the probability distribution is too peaked.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy to MD:**\n",
    "- Temperature doesn't CREATE variation, it PERMITS variation where uncertainty exists\n",
    "- For simple tasks, there's no uncertainty → no variation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: Prompt Perturbation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended approach:** Perturb the INPUT, not just the sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Strategies\n",
    "perturb='none'      # No perturbation\n",
    "perturb='prefix'    # Add \"[Attempt {i}] {query}\"\n",
    "perturb='thinking'  # Add thinking prompts (\"Think step by step\", etc.)\n",
    "perturb='rephrase'  # Rephrase query differently\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works:** Changes the model's initial state → different attention patterns → different reasoning paths"

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✓ **Metrics are mathematically correct**: All 78 tests passing, validated against ground truth\n",
    "2. ✓ **Metrics work with realistic data**: Correctly analyze actual trajectory log structures\n",
    "3. ✓ **Visualizations are interpretable**: Clear identification of diversity patterns\n",
    "4. ✓ **Temperature alone is insufficient**: Need prompt perturbation for reliable diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "**For stochastic evaluation:**\n",
    "- Use `temperature=0.7` + `perturb='thinking'` for best diversity\n",
    "- Run k=5-10 rollouts per task\n",
    "- Monitor Vendi Score and efficiency metrics\n",
    "- Target > 50% sampling efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "**For MaTTS implementation:**\n",
    "- Use diversity metrics to validate sampling quality before memory extraction\n",
    "- Track forking points to identify key decision moments\n",
    "- Use convergence plots to determine optimal k\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run baseline stochastic evaluation on UniProt subset (k=5-10)\n",
    "2. Analyze Pass@k vs. diversity metrics correlation\n",
    "3. Implement contrastive extraction (success vs. failure pairs)\n",
    "4. Integrate with SQLite ReasoningBank backend"
