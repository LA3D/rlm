    "This project implements the Recursive Language Model (RLM) architecture for querying RDF ontologies through progressive disclosure. The implementation follows the protocol from [Zhang et al. (2025)](https://github.com/alexzhang13/rlm) while using [claudette](https://claudette.answer.ai/) as the LLM backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work is part of an ongoing investigation into how LLM agents can navigate large knowledge graphs without overwhelming their context windows. Rather than loading entire ontologies into the prompt, the agent iteratively explores through bounded REPL operations, delegating heavy summarization tasks to sub-LLMs."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The RLM architecture addresses a fundamental tension in using LLMs for knowledge graph tasks: ontologies and query results are often too large to fit in context, yet the model needs semantic understanding to construct correct queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution externalizes the large context to a REPL environment. The root LLM emits small code blocks that execute against the graph, receiving truncated results. When more detail is needed, it delegates to sub-LLMs via `llm_query()` calls that summarize specific chunks. The process iterates until the model returns a final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation extends RLM with two complementary memory systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset memory** (RDF quads) stores domain facts discovered during exploration. An RDF Dataset provides named graphs for working memory (`mem`), provenance tracking (`prov`), and scratch space (`work/*`). Facts persist across queries and can be snapshotted for session continuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Procedural memory** ([ReasoningBank](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25140v1)-style) stores reusable methods extracted from past trajectories. After each RLM run, a judge evaluates success or failure, and an extractor distills procedural insights: query templates, debugging strategies, exploration heuristics. These are retrieved via BM25 for similar future tasks, allowing the agent to improve over time without relearning from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional components include SPARQL result handles that expose metadata without materializing full result sets, SHACL shape indexing for schema discovery, and query template retrieval from `sh:SPARQLExecutable` examples."
