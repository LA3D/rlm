Not_Obsolete_Protein - Current, active protein records\n2. Obsolete_Protein - Deprecated protein entries\n3. Reviewed_Protein - Manually curated and validated protein records\n\n**Properties and Relationships:**\nProteins have numerous properties including:\n- annotation, classifiedWith, encodedBy, encodedIn, existence, interaction\n- chainSequenceMapping, component, domain, isolatedFrom\n- mappedCitation, potentialSequence, oldMnemonic\n\n**Constraints:**\nThe class includes OWL restrictions ensuring that:\n- The replacedBy property only points to other Protein instances\n- The replaces property only points to other Protein instances\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Defined in: http://purl.uniprot.org/core/\n- Reference: http://www.uniprot.org/help/uniprotkb\n- Example instance: http://purl.uniprot.org/uniprot/P06017\n\nThe Protein class serves as the core ontological construct for representing protein data in UniProt, enabling structured, machine-readable descriptions of protein entities and their relationships.",
