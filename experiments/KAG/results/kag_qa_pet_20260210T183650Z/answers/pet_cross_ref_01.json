  "answer": "Table 1 contains \"Injected Doses of \u2078\u2079Zr-Nivolumab for Tracer only and Carrier-Added Studies in NHPs.\"\n\nThe table presents data for three experimental conditions:\n1. Tracer only\n2. Carrier-Added 1 mg/kg\n3. Carrier-Added 3 mg/kg\n\nFor each condition, the table provides:\n- \u2078\u2079Zr-nivolumab (RCY) - radiochemical yield values (225 MBq, 341 MBq, and 252 MBq respectively)\n- Specific activity (EOS) - end of synthesis values (252 MBq/mg, 402 MBq/mg, and 402 MBq/mg)\n- Radiochemical Purity (90%, 87%, and 87%)\n- Body weight NHP (non-human primate)\n- Injected dose\n- Injected activity\n\nThe table is referenced by one paragraph:\n- Paragraph ex:b_p005_0010 (page 5), which states: \"specific activity was calculated to be 352 \u00b1 87 MBq/mg, see Table 1 for individual reaction data.\"\n",
