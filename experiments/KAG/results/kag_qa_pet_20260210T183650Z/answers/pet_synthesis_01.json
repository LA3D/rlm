  "type": "synthesis",
  "answer": "The main conclusion about 89Zr-nivolumab biodistribution in the spleen is that it shows specific biodistribution to the spleen, and this uptake can be blocked by co-administration of excess unlabeled nivolumab. Specifically, carrier-added studies with 1 and 3 mg/kg nivolumab demonstrated that spleen uptake was reduced by an average of 82.5 \u00b1 4.6% (range: -75.2% to -87.0%) compared to tracer-only studies. This blockable uptake indicates that the spleen biodistribution is specific and receptor-mediated (PD-1 binding) rather than non-specific accumulation.",
