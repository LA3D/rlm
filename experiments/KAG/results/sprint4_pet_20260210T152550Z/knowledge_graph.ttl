    kag:fullText "Cancer immunotherapy, unlike traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic treatments, engages the immune system to identify cancer cells and stimulate immune responses. The Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) protein is an immunoinhibitory receptor expressed by activated cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) that seek out and destroy cancer cells. Multiple cancer types express and upregulate the Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2) which bind to PD-1 as an immune escape mechanism. Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) approved for treatment of multiple cancer types. This study reports the preparation and in vivo evaluation of  \\( ^{89} \\) Zr labeled nivolumab in healthy non-human primates (NHP) as a preliminary study of biodistribution and clearance. The radiochemical and in vivo stabilities of the  \\( ^{89} \\) Zr complex were shown to be acceptable for imaging. Three naïve NHPs were intravenously injected with tracer only or tracer co-injected with nivolumab followed by co-registered by positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), acquired for eight days following injection. Image-derived standardized uptake values (SUV) were quantified by region of interest (ROI) analysis. Radioactivity in the spleen was significantly reduced by addition of excess nivolumab compared to the tracer only study at all imaging time points. Liver uptake of the radiotracer was consistent as a clearance organ with minimal signal from other tissues: lung, muscle, brain, heart, and kidney. The results indicate specific biodistribution to the spleen, which can be blocked by co-administration of excess nivolumab. Distribution to other organs is consistent with elimination pathways of antibodies, with primary clearance through the liver." ;

For labeling of biologics, including mAbs, the focus is on matching the half-life of the biologic and isotope for optimal imaging. \\( ^{13} \\)  SPECT imaging is lower cost and more ubiquitous than PET, but has lower contrast and spatial resolution. \\( ^{14} \\)  The covalently bonded PET isotope  \\( {}^{124} \\) I has a half-life of 4.18 days (100.3 h) suited for mAb labeling and is also non-residualizing.

Each NHP underwent a radiotracer only (tracer only), or radiotracer with carrier-added (1 or 3 mg/kg of nivolumab) imaging study. On day 0, following a  \\( \\sim12 \\)  h fast, the NHPs were sedated with an intramuscular injection of ketamine to allow placement of a cephalic indwelling intravenous (IV) catheter for administration of dose of 0, 1 or 3 mg/kg nivolumab. On days 1, 4, 6 and 8, when co-registered PET and MRI studies were performed, anesthesia was induced with an intramuscular combination injection of 0.02 mg/kg atropine, 5 mg/kg ketamine, and 0.01 mg/kg buprenorphine. The NHPs were then maintained on 0.5–2% isoflurane inhalant with 100% oxygen at 1–2 L/min and vacuum scavenging. Once anesthetized, each NHP was placed in a tubular plastic imaging bed to maintain positioning between the PET and MRI during system transfer and to provide precise anatomical alignment. If necessary, ventilator tidal volume was utilized at 10–20 mL/kg for the procedure to maintain sufficient  \\( EtCO_{2} \\)  levels.

This is attributed to labeled nivolumab binding to circulating CD8⁺ T-cells and other lymphocytes, which is consistent with results published by Wang and co-workers in NHPs.¹⁹ Biodistribution of ⁸⁹Zr-nivolumab in other tissues was relatively low with uptake unaffected by the addition of 1 or 3 mg/kg of unlabeled nivolumab.
