    kag:fullText "Diels-Alder (DA) reactions are ubiquitous throughout chemistry. The utility of these reactions arises from the facile  \\( [4+2] \\)  cycloaddition of diene and dienophile, forming new C-C bonds, and giving rise to structurally and functionally diverse adducts. \\( ^{1} \\)  The synthetic utility of DA reactions is not limited to the forward reaction but also encompasses the retro Diels-Alder (rDA) cyclo-reversion, which can be used to access compounds challenging to obtain by other means. rDA reactions are often used to prepare reactive olefins and can be used in conjunction with the forward DA to isolate reactive molecules, such as benzoquinone epoxide. \\( ^{2,3} \\)  However, the need for elevated temperatures to promote cyclo-reversion has limited use of the reaction in synthetic chemistry. Molecules that access the rDA at milder conditions have received more attention in recent years, \\( ^{4} \\)  particularly for their use in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DCC). \\( ^{5,6} \\)  To develop stimuli-responsive and adaptive materials, DCC looks to harness properties that can aid in polymer healing, reprocessibility, and other dynamic functionalities. \\( ^{5,7-11} \\)  Though there are few reports detailing the features of rDA reactions, there are examples of steric and electronic changes of the diene and dienophile that give rise to reversible reactions at milder temperatures, in the range of -10 - 60 °C, \\( ^{12-14} \\)  and at varying rates. \\( ^{12,15} \\)  We looked to systematically explore the frontiers of DA reversibility by exploiting the electron-rich and sterically tunable 2,3,6,7-tetramethoxy-9,10-dialkylanthracene (TMAnR) platform (Figure 1)." ;

However, TMAnEt-DA, TMAnnBu-DA, and TMAnnHept-DA were all isolated as single crystals suitable for Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction (SCXRD) (Figure 6), either by evaporation of CT solutions (1:1.5 TMAnR:TCNE) at 25 °C for TMAnEt-DA and TMAnnBu-DA or at 5 °C for TMAnnHept-DA. The formation of DA adducts in the solid state likely arises from the initial crystallization of a CT complex, which rapidly cyclizes in the solid state. This phenomenon has been demonstrated previously for a variety of anthracene-based dienes and electron-poor dienophiles. \\( ^{36-44} \\)  Unlike in the previously published systems that remain as the DA adduct when re-dissolved, when crystals of TMAnEt-DA, TMAnnBu-DA, or TMAnnHept-DA are re-dissolved at room temperature they cyclo-revert rapidly, reforming equilibrium CT complexes in solution. Crystalline AnMe-DA, TMAnMe-DA, and TMAnEt-DA are completely colorless, as expected due to the breaking of conjugation. On the other hand, TMAnnBu-DA and TMAnnHept-DA crystals are orange and red, respectively. The color of these DA adduct single crystals is attributed to a trapped population of the CT complex that is too minor to model crystallographically. This is consistent with the proposed mechanism that DA crystals form through an initial CT complex that converts in the solid state. Such trapped CT populations are typical of crystals formed by this mechanism. \\( ^{36-43} \\)  A non-zero population of the CT complex was further confirmed by the presence of a CT band in the diffuse reflectance electronic absorption spectra (Figure S44 & S45). All DA adduct single crystals had solvent within the lattice, except for TMAnnHept-DA, which instead featured an additional two equivalents of cocrystallized TCNE. TMAnEtPh-DA did not form in the solid state; instead, a single crystal of TMAnEtPh-CT was obtained.

S.A.W. and N.J.G performed the stopped-flow studies collaboratively, with N.J.G. doing most of the data modelling. K.T.C refined all crystallographic data. A.K.Banki performed the DFT calculations.
