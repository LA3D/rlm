The Diels-Alder (DA) reaction is a widespread synthetic tool that can be employed both in the forward and reverse directions. The retro Diels-Alder (rDA) reaction is used to prepare reactive organic molecules and, more recently, as a type of Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DCC) for applications in polymer healing and reprocessibility. Synthetic and DCC applications of the rDA are limited by the high temperatures it typically requires. By tuning the sterics of a modular, electron-rich tetramethoxyanthracene donor platform, we are able to observe rapid rDA reactivity below-50 °C for cycloadducts with tetracyanoethylene (TCNE). We access these frontiers of reversibility by simultaneously stabilizing the free anthracene and destabilizing the DA adduct: the electron-rich nature of the tetramethoxyanthracenes lowers the energy of the starting materials, while alkyl substituents at the 9,10-positions of the anthracene donor destabilize the DA adduct. These features manifest in dynamic DA adducts with kinetically accessible DA/rDA reactions between-70 and 55 °C, as well as in the longest-known CC bond in a DA adduct formed by intermolecular cycloaddition (1.637(4) Å).
