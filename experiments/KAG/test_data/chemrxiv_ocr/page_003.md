adduct C-C bond lengths for the TMAnR molecules and corresponding adducts with TCNE investigated in this study. Taken together, these results 1) present the TMAnR platform as a useful, sterically tunable electron donor and diene, and 2) demonstrate how to achieve substantial thermodynamic tuning of the DA/rDA equilibrium using simultaneous stabilization of an electron-rich donor and destabilization of the DA adduct. We expect this approach to be broadly applicable to DA systems for synthetic organic chemistry and DCC applications.

## Results and Discussion

2,3,6,7-tetramethoxy-9,10-dialkyl-anthracenes (TMAnR, R = methyl, ethyl, nbutyl, nheptyl, and phenethyl, abbreviated Me, Et, nBu, nHept, and EtPh, respectively,) were readily prepared by reacting veratrole and the appropriately substituted aldehydes in sulfuric acid. \( ^{[28]} \)  TMAnMe, TMAnEt, and TMAnnBu were prepared following literature procedures. TMAnnHept and TMAnEtPh were prepared using an analogous procedure and are reported for the first time as part of this work (Figure S1-S4).

To assess how decoration with methoxy groups and 9,10-derivatization affects reduction potential, cyclic voltammetry was performed on AnMe as well as each TMAnR (Figure 2b, Table S1). The  \( E_{1/2} \)  of the first oxidation event of TMAnMe (0.38 V vs.  \( Fc^{+/0} \) ) is cathodically shifted with respect to those of An and AnMe by 0.36 and 0.27 V vs.  \( Fc^{+/0} \) , respectively. \( ^{[29]} \)  The other TMAnR are similarly cathodically shifted, with  \( E_{1/2} \)  values between 0.42 and 0.45 V vs  \( Fc^{+/0} \) . To benchmark the electron donating ability of the TMAnR series, we note that their first oxidation potentials are closer to those of canonical electron donors in organic materials chemistry such as tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) (0.31 V vs.  \( Fc^{+/0} \) ) \( ^{[30]} \)  than to that of unsubstituted An (0.74 V vs.  \( Fc^{+/0} \) ). \( ^{[31,32]} \)  Despite changes in 9,10-substituents, the oxidation potentials of the TMAnR donors remain fairly consistent (0.38 – 0.45 V vs.  \( Fc^{+/0} \) ). A shift to lower energy is observed in the DFT calculated gas-phase Ionization Potentials (IP) and Electron Affinities (EA) of the TMAnR donors compared to AnMe (Figure 2c). The TMAnR series thus represents a useful set of similarly electron-rich dienes with which to probe the effect of substitution at bridgehead positions on DA/rDA thermodynamics and kinetics.

Equimolar TCNE and either AnMe or TMAnMe react in dichloromethane (DCM) at 25 °C to form colorless DA adducts, as observed by  \( {}^{1} \) H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Figure S5 & S6). The adducts are readily isolable as powders in good yield. Under identical conditions, equimolar mixtures of TCNE and TMAnEt, TMAnnBu, TMAnnHept, or TMAnEtPh immediately form dark green solutions, indicative of the presence of CT complexes (Figure 3a) (TMAnR-CT). \( ^{33,34} \)  Peak broadening in the  \( {}^{1} \) H NMR of these mixtures is consistent with a dynamic equilibrium between neutral TMAnR + TCNE and TMAnR-CT (Figure 3b). For TMAnnBu, TMAnnHept, and TMAnEtPh, the room temperature equilibrium constants for CT complex
