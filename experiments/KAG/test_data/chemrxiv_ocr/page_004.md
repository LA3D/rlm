Figure 3. (a) Dynamic equilibrium of TMAnR (R = Et, nBu, nHept, EtPh) and TCNE with TMAnR-CT and the corresponding  \( K_{eqCT} \)  expression. (b)  \( {}^{1} \) H NMR spectra of mixtures of TMAnBu and TCNE used to determine  \( K_{eqCT} \) . The  \( {}^{1} \) H NMR signal for the methoxy groups is unaffected and was omitted for the sake of clarity. (c) Fit of  \( K_{eqCT} \)  for TMAnBu-CT at room temperature,  \( K_{eqCT} = 80 M^{-1} \) .

formation  \( (K_{\mathrm{eqCT}}) \)  were determined by fitting  \( {}^{1} \) H NMR titrations in deuterated DCM of the anthracene donor with TCNE (Figure 3c, Figures S9 – S13, Table S2). At a 1:1 ratio of donor to acceptor (each 0.005 M) there exists a 20-31% CT population, with the bulk of anthracene and TCNE remaining as the neutral species. For TMAnEt and TCNE, room temperature  \( {}^{1} \) H NMR spectra show a mixture of starting materials in rapid equilibrium with the CT complex (TMAnEt-CT) and the DA adduct (TMAnEt-DA). The titration experiment to determine  \( K_{eqCT} \)  was thus carried out at an elevated temperature to ensure that the only equilibrium measured was for the formation of the CT complex (Figure S7 & S8).

The presence of a CT population for each pair was further supported by the appearance of new absorbance bands, with peak absorbance in the range of  \( 750 - 760 \)  nm detected by solution UV-visible electronic absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis) (Figure S14 – S22). The molar ratio of donor to acceptor in the complex was determined to be 1:1 for each TMAnR-CT using a Job Plot (Figure S23 – S26). \( ^{35} \)

Variable temperature (VT)  \( {}^{1} \) H NMR experiments were carried out on solutions prepared with equimolar TMAnR and TCNE (0.05M) in deuterated DCM. Conversion to the corresponding DA adducts (TMAnEt-DA, TMAnBu-DA, TMAnHept-DA, and TMAnEtPh-DA) was observed between -60 and -80 °C, depending on the alkyl substituents (Figure 4, Figure S29 – S32). Full conversion is observed for TMAnEt-DA, TMAnBu-DA, and TMAnHept-DA while only a 90% conversion is seen for TMAnEtPh-DA at -80 °C. For each anthracene, returning to room-temperature restored the initial equilibrium between the free, neutral species and the small population of CT complex within minutes. At intermediate temperatures, four species are present in solution, with one equilibrium between the neutral TMAnR and TCNE and TMAnR-CT and another between the TMAnR-CT complex and the TMAnR-DA:

 \[ \begin{aligned}TMAnR+TCNE\Rightarrow TMAnR-CT\\ and\end{aligned} \] 

<|ref|>equation<|/ref|><|det|>[[600, 564, 830, 577]]<|/det|>
 \[ TMAnR-CT\rightleftharpoons TMAnR-DA \] 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[504, 579, 790, 591]]<|/det|>
The overall equilibrium expression is thus:

<|ref|>equation<|/ref|><|det|>[[616, 591, 808, 619]]<|/det|>
 \[ K_{eqDA}=\frac{[TMAnR-DA]}{[TMAnR][TCNE]} \]

To deconvolute [TMAnR] and [TMAnR-CT] by  \( {}^{1} \) H NMR, we would need the value of  \( K_{eqCT} \)  for each temperature point in the VT experiments. However, this value is not straightforward to determine at lower temperatures where TMAnR-DA is favored. The addition of more equivalents of TCNE as in the RT titrations discussed above will increase both [TMAnR-CT] and [TMAnR-DA], further obscuring our ability to determine accurate integrations and peak positions for the small non-TMAAnR-DA population at low temperatures. As a result, we are only able to determine the concentration of the combined non-TMAAnR-DA fraction, i.e. [TMAnR] + [TMAnR-CT]. Although not explicitly discussed in other literature reports, this is also the case for any DA reaction with a charge transfer intermediate, and we follow the same approach used in these other cases - so long as [TMAnR-CT] is small relative to [TMAnR], [TMAnR] + [TMAnR-CT] ≈ [TMAnR], and we can determine an approximate  \( K_{eqDA} \)  as shown below.

<|ref|>equation<|/ref|><|det|>[[550, 860, 882, 889]]<|/det|>
 \[ K_{eqDA}\approx\frac{[TMAnR-DA]}{([TMAnR]+[TMAnR-CT])[TCNE]} \]
