Figure 6. (a) AnMe-DA, (b) TMAnMe-DA, (c) TMAnEt-DA, (d) TMAnnBu-DA, (e) TMAnnHept-DA, and (f) TMAnEtPh-CT (Color scheme: C, grey; O, red; N, blue). DA adduct C-C bonds are outlined in red, with the average bond lengths listed. Hydrogen atoms, solvent molecules, and extra equivalents of TCNE are omitted for clarity.

the energy of the neutral donor is decreased remains relatively consistent. Meanwhile, as alkyl substituent length and complexity increase, there is increased strain at the bridgehead carbons. This lengthening and, therefore, weakening of bonds results in a less stable DA adduct. \( ^{47} \)  The lowered energy of the electron-rich donor and destabilization of the DA adduct are also reflected in the thermodynamic and kinetic trends discussed above.

## Conclusions

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[65, 570, 491, 727]]<|/det|>
We employed a highly modular, electron-rich scaffold, TMAnR, to explore how electronics and sterics can be leveraged to tune DA/rDA thermodynamics and kinetics. Upon combination with TCNE at ambient conditions, AnMe-DA and TMAnMe-DA readily formed, while the remaining TMAnR form equilibrium mixtures of CT complexes in solution. At much lower temperatures, the DA adducts for TMAnR with longer alkyl substituents were formed. The trend in reaction free energy indicates a decreased favorability for adduct formation for more electron-rich anthracenes with longer or more rigid substituents at bridgehead carbons.

All DA adducts were shown to form rapidly, with quantitative formation observed within one minute at  \( -80^{\circ}C \)  for TMAnnHept-DA. Diffraction-quality single crystals were obtained for all DA adducts aside from TMAnEtPh-DA. Longer C-C bonds were identified for the TMAnR-DA series than AnMe-DA, including the longest known C-C bond in a DA adduct,  \( 1.637(4) \)  Å in TMAnnHept-DA. Overall, combination of TMAnR (R = Et, nBu, nHept, EtPh) with TCNE results in dynamic DA/rDA equilibria well below  \( 25^{\circ}C \) . This work presents the easily prepared, electron-rich, and sterically tunable TMAnR platform as both a tool for investigation of steric and electronic effects and as a class of dienes that can undergo highly reversible DA reactions relevant to the design of DCC systems.

S.A.W. and A.K.Bartholomew conceived and planned the experiments. N.J.G. and J.M.M. assisted with experimental design and analysis. S.A.W. synthesized all compounds and collected all data apart from those from stopped-flow UV-Vis experiments and DFT calculations. S.A.W. and N.J.G performed the stopped-flow studies collaboratively, with N.J.G. doing most of the data modelling. K.T.C refined all crystallographic data. A.K.Banki performed the DFT calculations. S.A.W. wrote the text of the manuscript and A.K.Bartholomew and J.M.M. edited the manuscript.
