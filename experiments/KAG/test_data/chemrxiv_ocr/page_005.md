Figure 4. VT  \( {}^{1} \) H NMR experiments for TMAnnBu, with spectra shown every 20 °C. Separate solutions of equimolar TMAnnBu and TCNE were combined at 25 °C in an NMR tube. Warming from -80 °C to RT shows the complete cyclo-reversion of TMAnnBu-DA. The  \( ^{*} \)  denote relevant peaks for TMAnnBu-DA and TMAnnBu/TMAnnBu-CT.

Pure AnMe-DA and TMAnMe-DA are observed at 25 °C, so these species were studied by VT  \( {}^{1} \) H NMR at elevated temperatures to determine the onset of their respective rDA reactions in either deuterated acetonitrile or dioxane. By 65 °C and 55 °C, respectively, the rDA reactions began for AnMe-DA and TMAnMe-DA (Figure S27 & S28). When the reaction is cooled back to 25 °C, the DA adducts are found to be the sole species in solution, as expected. The 50/50 point of the DA:rDA equilibria is much lower for TMAnMe compared to AnMe. More broadly, the 50/50 point along the TMAnR-DA series was found to vary with the size of the alkyl substituent (Table 1). From the  \( K_{eqDA} \)  calculated at each temperature, thermodynamic parameters for the formation of DA adducts from equilibrium mixtures of neutral species and CT complexes were calculated, using the linear version of the van 't Hoff equation (Table 2, Figure S33 – S38).

The TMAnMe-DA adduct is less downhill from the free starting materials than AnMe-DA by 5 kcal·mol \( ^{-1} \)  at 25 °C. As the bridgehead sterics are the same for these two donors, the change is likely due to the increased electron density imparted by the methoxy groups of TMAnMe, which lowers the relative energy of the donor platform. The  \( \Delta G \)  for TMAnR-DA formation becomes less favorable along the TMAnR series as substituent length and complexity increases, with the least favorable  \( \Delta G \)  found for TMAnEtPh-DA. The lower driving force follows the same trend across all temperature points:  \( \Delta G_{AnMe-DA} > \Delta G_{TMAnMe-DA} > \Delta G_{TMAnEt-DA} > \Delta G_{TMAnnBu-DA} \approx \Delta G_{TMAnnHept-DA} > \Delta G_{TMAnEtPh-DA} \) . The formation of the DA adduct is more favorable at lower temperatures, as the DA adduct is the enthalpically favored product. Increasing the size of the R-substituent makes  \( \Delta G \)  less negative, allowing us to tune the 50/50 point of the DA:rDA equilibrium over a 175 °C range.

## Reaction Kinetics and Energy Barriers

In our VT NMR studies, the DA:rDA equilibrium was established within the time needed to stabilize the NMR instrument at each temperature for all TMAnR. Still, we wanted to quantify the impact of the steric tuning at the 9,10 positions on the kinetics of DA formation/cyclo-reversion as rapid kinetics are preferable for DCC applications. The kinetics of adduct formation were studied using stopped-flow UV-Vis. Due to the nature of this technique, experiments were largely carried out at far lower concentrations than those employed for VT NMR (see Figure 5 caption).

Equimolar amounts of each anthracene and TCNE solution were combined in DCM at  \( -80^{\circ} \) C, resulting in the appearance of a CT band between 600 – 700 nm. In each case, this CT band was observed at its maximum intensity in the first measured spectrum after the 10 – 15 ms instrument mixing time (Figure 5). The formation of the CT complex is therefore very rapid, even at low temperatures and at the 0.06 mM concentrations ( \( k > 10^{6} \)  M \( ^{-1} \)  s \( ^{-1} \) ). The subsequent decay of the CT band, indicating the formation of the DA adduct, is the rate limiting step for the overall transformation. Using the back-calculated  \( K_{eq193K} \)  from the previous section and the concentrations used for the stopped-flow experiments, we calculate the expected percent conversion to the DA adduct. For all adducts, apart from TMAnEtPh-DA, the percent conversion is greater than 95%. The kinetics of the decay of the CT complex fit well to a first-order expression and the resulting rate constants are given in Table 3.
