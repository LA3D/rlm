Upon conclusion of PET and MRI co-registration image acquisition, the NHP was recovered by placement on a warm water recirculating pad and provided supplemental oxygen. Once the NHP was extubated and the gag reflex recovered, the animal was transferred to an isolation room with food and water until the next experiment day.

For anatomic co-registration with PET images, anatomical MRI scans were performed for each cynomolgus monkey. High resolution axial or coronal images were acquired using the Bruker RARE sequence with the following parameters TR/TE = 3100/40 ms, FOV = 18cm², MTX = 256², slice thickness = 5 mm, 27 axial slices, with four averages and an acquisition time of 13 min to cover brain to lung area with an animal position change and a repeat MRI to cover the lower lung to the genital area using these same imaging parameters for full body coverage.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[48, 425, 481, 518]]<|/det|>
PET images (axial field of view of 7.6 cm) were acquired and scanners calibrated for  \( {}^{89} \) Zr imaging. A 10 min  \( {}^{57} \) Co transmission scan was acquired for correction of photon attenuation. 3 D volumetric images of the whole body were reconstructed using filtered back projection (128 pixels × 128 pixels, 95 slices, and 1.89 mm × 1.89 mm × 0.796 mm voxel size with corrections for decay, dead-time, random events, and attenuation).

54.5 ± 11.0 MBq of  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-DFO-nivolumab was injected as a slow bolus over 20 min via cephalic vein in each NHP immediately after quality control release of the tracer. PET images were acquired at days 1, 4, 6, and 8 following intravenous infusion with radiotracer only, or radiotracer with carrier-added nivolumab (1 or 3 mg/kg) at day 0. Each scan covered 7 bed positions (7.6 cm/ bed and 13% overlap between beds) with a 10 min emission acquisition per bed.

MRI and PET images were manually co-registered using fiducial markers and anatomical information in software-co-registration. The regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn on the MRI images, and applied to the co-registered PET images (Fig. S6). The brain, thymus, heart, spleen, kidney, lung, liver, stomach wall, spine, and background area (e.g. muscle) were selected for calculating radioactivity concentration using the software tool, a Medical Image Data Examiner (AMIDE). \( ^{29} \)  Image-derived biodistribution over the course of the imaging study (up to 8 days post injection, p.i.) were measured as standardized uptake values (SUVs) in the identified regions for all imaging data sets.

## 3.1. Conjugation and characterization of nivolumab-DFO

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[499, 234, 933, 392]]<|/det|>
Preparation of nivolumab-DFO in Scheme 1, step 1, was achieved through thiourea bond formation between the p-SCN-Bn-DFO chelator and lysine on the mAb. Nivolumab-DFO was isolated after purification with a yield of 88% (8.8 mg, 0.44 mg/mL in PBS) from the parent mAb (10 mg). Purity was determined to be  \( >95\% \)  with a CAR of 1.14 (Fig. S3). The chelate ratio was determined by LC-MS versus isotope dilution assay. \( ^{30-32} \)  Future synthesis should lower the excess of the p-SCN-Bn-DFO chelator from 20-fold to 3-fold and DMSO concentration from 10% to below 2% to reduce precipitation of the mAb as recommended by Vosjan and co-workers. \( ^{28} \) 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[499, 392, 933, 553]]<|/det|>
The  \( K_{D} \)  values for nivolumab and nivolumab-DFO binding to hPD-1 are similar with a  \( K_{D} \)  of 3.10 nM for nivolumab and 3.75 nM for nivolumab-DFO (Fig. S4). These are comparable to binding of nivolumab to cynoPD-1 with a  \( K_{D} \)  of 3.92 nM. \( ^{19} \)  Nivolumab-DFO was stored in single use vials (1 mL of 1.5 mg/mL) at  \( -78^{\circ}C \)  and allowed to warm to room temperature prior to conjugation with  \( {}^{89}Zr \) . The purity after one freeze thaw cycle was unchanged as observed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Fig. S5). The characterized nivolumab-DFO was determined to be representative of the parent nivolumab mAb and acceptable for  \( {}^{89}Zr \)  labeling and imaging.

## 3.2. Radiolabeling and quality control of  \( ^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[499, 595, 934, 705]]<|/det|>
 \( ^{89} \) Zr-labeling yielded 225–341 MBq of  \( ^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab with a moderate radiochemical yield of  \( 53 \pm 8\% \)  (non-decay-corrected). Both yields were recorded from the fraction used for imaging to optimize purity, thus resulting in a lower observed yields than the reaction produced. Purification of the tracer was done with PBS which could have hindered the yield due to interaction of the chloride ions resulting in radiolysis or phosphate chelating free  \( ^{89} \) Zr. \( ^{28,33} \)  Yields could be improved by modifying the
