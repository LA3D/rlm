Cancer immunotherapy, unlike traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic treatments, engages the immune system to identify cancer cells and stimulate immune responses. The Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) protein is an immunoinhibitory receptor expressed by activated cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) that seek out and destroy cancer cells. Multiple cancer types express and upregulate the Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2) which bind to PD-1 as an immune escape mechanism. Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) approved for treatment of multiple cancer types. This study reports the preparation and in vivo evaluation of  \( ^{89} \) Zr labeled nivolumab in healthy non-human primates (NHP) as a preliminary study of biodistribution and clearance. The radiochemical and in vivo stabilities of the  \( ^{89} \) Zr complex were shown to be acceptable for imaging. Three naïve NHPs were intravenously injected with tracer only or tracer co-injected with nivolumab followed by co-registered by positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), acquired for eight days following injection. Image-derived standardized uptake values (SUV) were quantified by region of interest (ROI) analysis. Radioactivity in the spleen was significantly reduced by addition of excess nivolumab compared to the tracer only study at all imaging time points. Liver uptake of the radiotracer was consistent as a clearance organ with minimal signal from other tissues: lung, muscle, brain, heart, and kidney. The results indicate specific biodistribution to the spleen, which can be blocked by co-administration of excess nivolumab. Distribution to other organs is consistent with elimination pathways of antibodies, with primary clearance through the liver.

## 1. Introduction

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[66, 743, 496, 850], [516, 717, 944, 796]]<|/det|>
The standard of care for many cancers includes combinations of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical resection when possible. However, each of these treatments can have undesirable side effects that can impact a patient's quality of life. Cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments are intended to disproportionately kill cancer cells, but can have off-target effects with the host's immune system including changes in composition, phenotype, and function of immune cells. \( ^{1} \)  As an alternative, cancer immunotherapy utilizes the immune system to identify cancer cells and stimulate the host's immune response to treat the cancer. \( ^{2} \)  This includes monoclonal antibody (mAb) based therapies that have recently gained rapid clinical success and often with milder side effects. \( ^{3} \)  Understanding T-cell activation and regulation are key to developing successful mAb immunotherapy.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[516, 796, 945, 903]]<|/det|>
When T-cells recognize cancer antigens, they activate a population of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) that seek out and destroy cancer cells. As part of this process, CTLs upregulate expression of the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) protein on their surface. \( ^{4} \)  PD-1 is a negative regulatory molecule expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes that can bind to its natural ligands Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2) on neighboring cells as an immune system checkpoint, thus resulting in negative regulation.

of T-cell activation. \( ^{5} \)  Inhibition of the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands promote immune responses and antigen-specific T-cell responses to both foreign antigens as well as self-antigens. Many cancers express and upregulate PD-L1 and PD-L2 as an immune escape mechanism leading to evasion of the host's antitumor immune response. \( ^{6} \) 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[48, 160, 479, 345]]<|/det|>
Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 anti-PD-1 mAb also known as Opdivo, BMS-936558, MDX-1106, and ONO-4538. \( ^{7} \)  Japan approved nivolumab as the world's first PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in July 2014 for advanced melanoma. It has approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for advanced melanoma, advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and other indications. \( ^{8,9} \)  Multiple clinical trials of single and combination therapy with the anti-CTL antigen-4 mAb, ipilimumab (Yervoy), are ongoing at the time of this publication. \( ^{10,11} \)  Nivolumab targets PD-1 on CTLs thus preventing binding to PD-L1 and subsequent inactivation of the host immune response. There are clinical trials for anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies creating competition in the pre-clinical and clinical research space. \( ^{12} \) 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[48, 345, 479, 609]]<|/det|>
In recent years, a number of radioisotopes have been employed for antibody-based positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. For labeling of biologics, including mAbs, the focus is on matching the half-life of the biologic and isotope for optimal imaging. \( ^{13} \)  SPECT imaging is lower cost and more ubiquitous than PET, but has lower contrast and spatial resolution. \( ^{14} \)  The covalently bonded PET isotope  \( {}^{124} \) I has a half-life of 4.18 days (100.3 h) suited for mAb labeling and is also non-residualizing. However,  \( {}^{124} \) I suffers limitations due to thyroid uptake following in vivo dehalogenation as well as decreased resolution. \( ^{15} \)  Chelator based PET radioisotopes for labeling mAbs and fragments include  \( {}^{68} \) Ga,  \( {}^{64} \) Cu, and  \( {}^{86} \) Y with half-lives of 1.1, 12.7, and 14.7 h, respectively. \( ^{16} \)   \( {}^{89} \) Zr with a longer half-life of 3.27 days (78.4 h) and relatively low positron energy of 395.5 keV is particularly well suited for imaging of full mAbs, because pharmacokinetics can require days for optimal biodistribution. \( ^{17,18} \)  Given that nivolumab has a dose-dependent half-life of 5 (1 mg/kg) to 10 days (10 mg/kg) in NHPs,  \( {}^{89} \) Zr was chosen as a compatible isotope for preliminary pre-clinical imaging in NHPs. \( ^{19} \) 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[48, 608, 480, 872]]<|/det|>
Desferrioxamine (DFO) is the most common chelator for  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-labeling, available commercially as  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-oxalate. \( ^{17} \)  There are many other chelators for  \( {}^{89} \) Zr, but DFO is the most widely used for in vivo imaging due to stability of the DFO- \( Zr^{4+} \)  complex, the commercial availability of DFO, and translational use in human clinical imaging. \( ^{14} \)  Modification of mAbs with DFO can be achieved by bioconjugation to lysine amino acid residues with amine reactive linkers such as succinylate or isothiocyanate (SCN) chemistry. \( ^{20} \)  It is important to determine the conjugate to antibody ratio (CAR) to minimize loss of biological activity from over modification. Site-specific DFO labeling of mAbs has been examined using thiol reactive linkers with engineered cysteine residues on the mAb trastuzumab. \( ^{21} \)  Labeling of the clinical asset nivolumab is ideally done through random lysine conjugation since it does not require reengineering or deglycosylation of the nivolumab mAb. Binding of the modified DFO-mAb should be compared to the parent mAb by cell binding assays, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), or an equivalent technique to make sure modification has not significantly altered the biological activity of the mAb.

PET imaging in combination with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide valuable guidance in drug development for antibody based therapies in animal models by providing real time dynamic imaging of potential drug candidates. \( ^{[22]} \)  PET labeled mAbs can also aid in early clinical trials by improving patient selection and dose parameters while providing valuable insight into patient dose responses. \( ^{[23,24]} \)  As of 2015 more than 15 mAbs have been  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-labeled for clinical PET imaging in cancer patients, a growing area of research. \( ^{[25,26]} \)  This study reports the first radiolabeling procedure and in vivo evaluation of  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab in healthy NHPs.

## 2. Experimental

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[501, 194, 740, 208]]<|/det|>
## 2.1. Nivolumab conjugation with DFO

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[499, 220, 931, 287]]<|/det|>
Nivolumab was modified by formation of a thiourea linkage to the bifunctional DFO chelator derivative, 1-(4-isothiocyanatophenyl)-3-[6,17-dihydroxy-7,10,18,21-tetraoxo-27-(N-acetylhydroxylamino)-6,11,17,22-tetraazaheptaecisoanet]thiourea (p-SCN-Bn-DFO, Scheme. 1, step 1, Macrocyclics, B-705).

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[499, 287, 932, 419]]<|/det|>
Nivolumab (10 mg/mL in sodium citrate, sodium chloride, mannitol, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and polysorbate 80 (Tween 80), pH 6.0; Bristol-Myers Squibb, lot 3A78017) was diluted 10-fold in 0.1 M NaHCO \( _{3} \) , pH 9.0. A 20-fold excess of p-SCN-Bn-DFO in 1 mL DMSO was added to the mAb (10 mg in 9 mL) and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Precipitant was removed by 0.22  \( \mu \) m syringe filtration and the unconjugated chelate was removed by SEC using a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) and PBS buffer (150 mM NaCl, 200 mM NaPO \( _{4} \) , pH 7.2, Sigma-Aldrich) as eluent.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[499, 419, 931, 485]]<|/det|>
The purity was determined by analytical SEC (10/300 GL Superdex 200, PBS buffer mobile phase) and protein concentration by NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer. A CAR was calculated from the relative peak intensities in the deconvoluted LC/MS spectra of intact and/or reduced nivolumab-DFO.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[499, 484, 932, 696]]<|/det|>
SPR experiments were performed to calculate the  \( K_{D} \)  for human PD-1 (hPD1(25–167)-Myc-TVMV-His, Bristol-Myers Squibb) to nivolumab and nivolumab-DFO. \( ^{27} \)  Each study was done at 25 °C using a ProteOn XPR36 instrument with a running buffer of PBS with 0.05% Tween (TEKNOVA, P1192), that is held constant throughout the experiment. An anti-human IgG mAb was directly immobilized via amine coupling on a GLC sensor chip. The chip surface was then activated with a 1:1 mixture of 40 mM N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 10 mM N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS) for 5 min (BioRad, Proteo Anime Coupling Kit, 1762410). AffiniPure goat anti-human IgG (HC + LC) was injected at 10  \( \mu \) g/mL in sodium acetate pH 5 for 2 min (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, West Grove, PA, cat #109-005-003, Lot:100508). Remaining reactive groups were blocked by treatment with 1M ethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.5 for 5 min.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[498, 696, 932, 854]]<|/det|>
Response levels obtained for the primary mAb were approximately 3000 RU. Nivolumab and nivolumab-DFO were captured on the surface by the anti-human IgG to a response level of approximately 550 RU. Five concentrations of hPD-1 (from 40 nM to 2.5 nM, with a 2-fold serial dilution in the running buffer) were injected at 30  \( \mu \) L/min for 3 min and the dissociation was monitored for 10 min. Surfaces were regenerated with two injections of 0.85%  \( H_{3}PO_{4} \)  (100  \( \mu \) L/min for 18 s). SPR Data was analyzed using the ProteoOn Manager Software v3.1 and interspot data was used as reference and a buffer injection was used as double reference. Processed data was fit to a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model.

## 2.2. Radiolabeling and quality control of  \( ^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[499, 897, 932, 952]]<|/det|>
 \( ^{89} \) Zr-oxalic acid was produced via the  \( {}^{89} \) Y(p,n) \( ^{89} \) Zr transmutation reaction on a cyclotron and procured from IBA Molecular North America, Inc. (Richmond, VA) with overnight delivery to Bristol-Myers Squibb (Princeton, NJ). The  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab was

<|ref|>figure_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[66, 879, 490, 893]]<|/det|>
Scheme 1. Nivolumab conjugation to p-SCN-Bn-DFO and radiolabeling with  \( ^{89} \) Zr \( ^{4+} \) .

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[65, 910, 494, 951], [515, 82, 946, 174]]<|/det|>
prepared from  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-oxalate and nivolumab-DFO following the procedures reported by Vosjan and co-workers with minor modifications (Scheme. 1, step 2). \( ^{28} \)  An average of 15 mCi of  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-oxalic acid in 300  \( \mu \) L was neutralized with 300  \( \mu \) L of 2 M Na \( _{2} \) CO \( _{3} \) . The volume was then diluted with 0.5 mL of 0.5 M HEPES buffer (pH 7.2). To this solution, nivolumab-DFO was added (0.5 mL of 1.5 mg/mL, 750  \( \mu \) g) then an additional 0.2 mL HEPES to bring the volume to 1.8 mL, gently mixed, and held at room temperature for 1 h. Due to the nature of  \( {}^{89} \) Zr production, reagent volumes are optimized from the received volume of  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-oxalic acid.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[515, 174, 947, 413]]<|/det|>
The reaction was transferred to a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with PBS buffer prior to loading of sample and eluted with PBS buffer. A void volume of 0.7 mL was discarded followed by the collection of four fractions of 1–1.5 mL based on radioactive counts eluting from the column. Generally the first 1 mL fraction contained minimal radioactivity followed by a 1.5 mL fraction with the majority of purified  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab that would be used in imaging. Two additional fractions of 1 and 1.5 mL were collected and determined to contain additional  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab and other radioactive components. The radioactive counts were monitored during fraction collection to optimize purity of  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab. Radioactivity of each fraction was recorded and the purity determined by SEC (10/300 GL Superdex 200, PBS buffer mobile phase) with specific activity calculated from NanoDrop protein concentration. The product was sterile filtered for NHP imaging through a sterile Syringe Filter (0.2  \( \mu \) m) into a sterile vial fitted with a sterile vent filter (0.2  \( \mu \) m).

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[517, 424, 670, 438]]<|/det|>
## 2.3. Animal preparation

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[515, 451, 946, 503]]<|/det|>
All animal procedures were in strict accordance with the recommendations of the animal care and use committee (ACUC) of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company for the care and use of laboratory animals.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[515, 503, 947, 885]]<|/det|>
PET images were acquired (microPET F220 scanner (Siemens Preclinical Solutions, Knoxville, TN)) were acquired and co-registered with MRI (4.7 T/40 cm system (Bruker Biospin, Billerica MA)) on three male cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) NHPs weighing  \( 4.97 \pm 0.51 \)  kg. Each NHP underwent a radiotracer only (tracer only), or radiotracer with carrier-added (1 or 3 mg/kg of nivolumab) imaging study. On day 0, following a  \( \sim12 \)  h fast, the NHPs were sedated with an intramuscular injection of ketamine to allow placement of a cephalic indwelling intravenous (IV) catheter for administration of dose of 0, 1 or 3 mg/kg nivolumab. On days 1, 4, 6 and 8, when co-registered PET and MRI studies were performed, anesthesia was induced with an intramuscular combination injection of 0.02 mg/kg atropine, 5 mg/kg ketamine, and 0.01 mg/kg buprenorphine. The NHPs were then maintained on 0.5–2% isoflurane inhalant with 100% oxygen at 1–2 L/min and vacuum scavenging. Once anesthetized, each NHP was placed in a tubular plastic imaging bed to maintain positioning between the PET and MRI during system transfer and to provide precise anatomical alignment. If necessary, ventilator tidal volume was utilized at 10–20 mL/kg for the procedure to maintain sufficient  \( EtCO_{2} \)  levels. Every 15 min the NHPs'  \( SpO_{2} \) ,  \( EtCO_{2} \) , body temperature, respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR) were recorded. In addition, Lactated Ringer's Solution was provided as a constant rate infusion via an indwelling IV catheter during the procedure at approximately 10 mL/kg/hr until the conclusion of imaging. Body temperature was sustained during anesthesia events using warm water recirculating pads placed under the NHPs during the scans and in recovery.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[515, 885, 947, 952]]<|/det|>
To measure concentration of nivolumab in carrier-added groups, blood samples were collected pre- and post-infusion on day 0, as well as on days 1, 4, 6, and 8. All samples were collected in EDTA Vacutainer \( ^{\circledR} \)  tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Company), centrifuged to separate the plasma, frozen for 33 days to allow

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[48, 81, 480, 134]]<|/det|>
the radioisotope to decay and sent to Pharmaceutical Product Development, LLC. (Richmond, VA) for analysis. Radiometabolite analysis was not done, but would be a valuable addition to future studies.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[48, 134, 481, 215]]<|/det|>
Upon conclusion of PET and MRI co-registration image acquisition, the NHP was recovered by placement on a warm water recirculating pad and provided supplemental oxygen. Once the NHP was extubated and the gag reflex recovered, the animal was transferred to an isolation room with food and water until the next experiment day.

## 2.4. Magnetic resonance imaging

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[48, 253, 481, 387]]<|/det|>
For anatomic co-registration with PET images, anatomical MRI scans were performed for each cynomolgus monkey. High resolution axial or coronal images were acquired using the Bruker RARE sequence with the following parameters TR/TE = 3100/40 ms, FOV = 18cm², MTX = 256², slice thickness = 5 mm, 27 axial slices, with four averages and an acquisition time of 13 min to cover brain to lung area with an animal position change and a repeat MRI to cover the lower lung to the genital area using these same imaging parameters for full body coverage.

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[49, 399, 442, 414]]<|/det|>
## 2.5. Positron emission tomography imaging and image analysis

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[48, 425, 481, 518]]<|/det|>
PET images (axial field of view of 7.6 cm) were acquired and scanners calibrated for  \( {}^{89} \) Zr imaging. A 10 min  \( {}^{57} \) Co transmission scan was acquired for correction of photon attenuation. 3 D volumetric images of the whole body were reconstructed using filtered back projection (128 pixels × 128 pixels, 95 slices, and 1.89 mm × 1.89 mm × 0.796 mm voxel size with corrections for decay, dead-time, random events, and attenuation).

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[48, 518, 481, 623]]<|/det|>
54.5 ± 11.0 MBq of  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-DFO-nivolumab was injected as a slow bolus over 20 min via cephalic vein in each NHP immediately after quality control release of the tracer. PET images were acquired at days 1, 4, 6, and 8 following intravenous infusion with radiotracer only, or radiotracer with carrier-added nivolumab (1 or 3 mg/kg) at day 0. Each scan covered 7 bed positions (7.6 cm/ bed and 13% overlap between beds) with a 10 min emission acquisition per bed.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[48, 623, 481, 704], [499, 81, 933, 162]]<|/det|>
MRI and PET images were manually co-registered using fiducial markers and anatomical information in software-co-registration. The regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn on the MRI images, and applied to the co-registered PET images (Fig. S6). The brain, thymus, heart, spleen, kidney, lung, liver, stomach wall, spine, and background area (e.g. muscle) were selected for calculating radioactivity concentration using the software tool, a Medical Image Data Examiner (AMIDE). \( ^{29} \)  Image-derived biodistribution over the course of the imaging study (up to 8 days post injection, p.i.) were measured as standardized uptake values (SUVs) in the identified regions for all imaging data sets.

## 3. Results and discussion

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[501, 208, 853, 223]]<|/det|>
## 3.1. Conjugation and characterization of nivolumab-DFO

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[499, 234, 933, 392]]<|/det|>
Preparation of nivolumab-DFO in Scheme 1, step 1, was achieved through thiourea bond formation between the p-SCN-Bn-DFO chelator and lysine on the mAb. Nivolumab-DFO was isolated after purification with a yield of 88% (8.8 mg, 0.44 mg/mL in PBS) from the parent mAb (10 mg). Purity was determined to be  \( >95\% \)  with a CAR of 1.14 (Fig. S3). The chelate ratio was determined by LC-MS versus isotope dilution assay. \( ^{30-32} \)  Future synthesis should lower the excess of the p-SCN-Bn-DFO chelator from 20-fold to 3-fold and DMSO concentration from 10% to below 2% to reduce precipitation of the mAb as recommended by Vosjan and co-workers. \( ^{28} \) 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[499, 392, 933, 553]]<|/det|>
The  \( K_{D} \)  values for nivolumab and nivolumab-DFO binding to hPD-1 are similar with a  \( K_{D} \)  of 3.10 nM for nivolumab and 3.75 nM for nivolumab-DFO (Fig. S4). These are comparable to binding of nivolumab to cynoPD-1 with a  \( K_{D} \)  of 3.92 nM. \( ^{19} \)  Nivolumab-DFO was stored in single use vials (1 mL of 1.5 mg/mL) at  \( -78^{\circ}C \)  and allowed to warm to room temperature prior to conjugation with  \( {}^{89}Zr \) . The purity after one freeze thaw cycle was unchanged as observed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Fig. S5). The characterized nivolumab-DFO was determined to be representative of the parent nivolumab mAb and acceptable for  \( {}^{89}Zr \)  labeling and imaging.

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[501, 569, 851, 585]]<|/det|>
## 3.2. Radiolabeling and quality control of  \( ^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[499, 595, 934, 705]]<|/det|>
 \( ^{89} \) Zr-labeling yielded 225–341 MBq of  \( ^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab with a moderate radiochemical yield of  \( 53 \pm 8\% \)  (non-decay-corrected).

## 3.3. In vivo PET imaging in normal healthy cynomolgus monkeys

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[66, 766, 495, 845]]<|/det|>
In vivo PET imaging with  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab was performed with tracer only, or carrier-added (1 and 3 mg/kg of nivolumab) in cynomolgus monkeys at multiple time-points. Maximum intensity projections are shown in Fig. 2. Since nivolumab has no PD-1 cross-reactivity in rodents, primates were selected as the pre-clinical imaging model. \( ^{34} \) 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[66, 845, 496, 952], [515, 569, 945, 622]]<|/det|>
PET derived images of NHPs (Fig. 3), revealed that distribution of radioactivity into the spleen was reduced by the addition of unlabeled nivolumab compared to tracer only studies at all imaging time points ( \( -82.5 \pm 4.6\% \) ; range:  \( -75.2 \)  to  \( -87.0\% \) , Table 2). Due to the small number of test animals, statistical data could not be provided. The PK for the two pre-dosed NHPs are reported in Table 3. In the PK analysis, the concentration of nivolumab in carrier-added of 1 mg/kg is  \( 18.9 \mu g/mL \)  at 0.25 h after infusion, more detailed data is shown in Tables 2 and 3. Bone uptake of  \( {}^{89} \) Zr was observed, due to liberation of  \( {}^{89} \) Zr from the DFO chelator, a known effect. There are a growing number of publications exploring more robust chelators to avoid this problem. \( {}^{35,36} \) 

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[515, 622, 946, 766]]<|/det|>
This is the first labeling of nivolumab with  \( {}^{89} \) Zr for imaging with co-registered PET/MRI imaging to evaluate the specific binding and biodistribution of nivolumab in vivo with healthy NHPs. Despite a small number of animals, the results from this study show that splenic uptake of  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab is markedly influenced by co-administration of nivolumab in a carrier-added setting. This finding suggests that the  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab uptake in the spleen is mediated by specific binding of nivolumab to dendritic cells traversing the spleen. Uptake in the liver is consistent with the expected clearance mechanism of anti-PD-1 mAb with no uptake changes noted in carrier-added studies.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[515, 767, 946, 952]]<|/det|>
The average percent change in the spleen (Table 2, -82.5 ± 4.6%) matched well with PD-1 receptor occupancy on circulating CD3⁺ T-cells after single infusion. As reported by Brahmer and co-workers, the mean PD-1 occupancies were 85% (70–97%) at peak, and 72% (59–81%) at plateau in humans.³⁷ In the NHP dosed with tracer only, ⁸⁹Zr-nivolumab uptake in the lymph nodes increased over time. This is attributed to labeled nivolumab binding to circulating CD8⁺ T-cells and other lymphocytes, which is consistent with results published by Wang and co-workers in NHPs.¹⁹ Biodistribution of ⁸⁹Zr-nivolumab in other tissues was relatively low with uptake unaffected by the addition of 1 or 3 mg/kg of unlabeled nivolumab. Measured intensities in these tissues show monotonic decrease over time consistent with nonspecific tracer distribution and clearance.

## 4. Conclusion

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[49, 285, 480, 484]]<|/det|>
These studies demonstrate that the anti-PD-1 HuMAb nivolumab can be modified with the bifunctional chelator DFO and radiolabeled with  \( {}^{89} \) Zr with good purity and radiochemical yield. The in vivo NIHP imaging with tracer only  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab indicates specific biodistribution to the spleen. Carrier-added studies of 1 and 3 mg/kg show spleen uptake can be blocked by a co-administration of excess nivolumab. In all studies, tracer distribution to other organs was consistent with the excretion pathways of antibodies, with primary clearance through the liver. This report details the first ever radiolabeling and PET imaging of nivolumab in a non-human primate. The success of this methodology adds to the body of knowledge encompassing the in vivo biodistribution of immune-oncology agents. Approaches described herein could readily be translated to the clinic for future studies of immunooncology modifying molecules.
