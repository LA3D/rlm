Cancer immunotherapy, unlike traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic treatments, engages the immune system to identify cancer cells and stimulate immune responses. The Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) protein is an immunoinhibitory receptor expressed by activated cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) that seek out and destroy cancer cells. Multiple cancer types express and upregulate the Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2) which bind to PD-1 as an immune escape mechanism. Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) approved for treatment of multiple cancer types. This study reports the preparation and in vivo evaluation of  \( ^{89} \) Zr labeled nivolumab in healthy non-human primates (NHP) as a preliminary study of biodistribution and clearance. The radiochemical and in vivo stabilities of the  \( ^{89} \) Zr complex were shown to be acceptable for imaging. Three naïve NHPs were intravenously injected with tracer only or tracer co-injected with nivolumab followed by co-registered by positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), acquired for eight days following injection. Image-derived standardized uptake values (SUV) were quantified by region of interest (ROI) analysis. Radioactivity in the spleen was significantly reduced by addition of excess nivolumab compared to the tracer only study at all imaging time points. Liver uptake of the radiotracer was consistent as a clearance organ with minimal signal from other tissues: lung, muscle, brain, heart, and kidney. The results indicate specific biodistribution to the spleen, which can be blocked by co-administration of excess nivolumab. Distribution to other organs is consistent with elimination pathways of antibodies, with primary clearance through the liver.

## 1. Introduction

The standard of care for many cancers includes combinations of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical resection when possible. However, each of these treatments can have undesirable side effects that can impact a patient's quality of life. Cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments are intended to disproportionately kill cancer cells, but can have off-target effects with the host's immune system including changes in composition, phenotype, and function of immune cells. \( ^{1} \)  As an alternative, cancer immunotherapy utilizes the immune system to identify cancer cells and stimulate the host's immune response to treat the cancer. \( ^{2} \)  This includes monoclonal antibody (mAb) based therapies that have recently gained rapid clinical success and often with milder side effects. \( ^{3} \)  Understanding T-cell activation and regulation are key to developing successful mAb immunotherapy.

When T-cells recognize cancer antigens, they activate a population of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) that seek out and destroy cancer cells. As part of this process, CTLs upregulate expression of the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) protein on their surface. \( ^{4} \)  PD-1 is a negative regulatory molecule expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes that can bind to its natural ligands Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2) on neighboring cells as an immune system checkpoint, thus resulting in negative regulation.
