purification conditions in future studies to isolate more  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab with 0.25 M sodium acetate buffer as an alternative to PBS. Protein concentration was determined by NanoDrop and specific activity was calculated to be  \( 352 \pm 87 \)  MBq/mg, see Table 1 for individual reaction data. Analysis by SEC determined the samples had good purity of >87% with the only detectable impurity being a single peak for a higher molecular weight species (HMWs) most likely an aggregate. The nivolumab-DFO precursor was greater than 95% pure.  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab identity was confirmed by SEC with co-injection of a molecular weight gel filtration standard and nivolumab-DFO precursor, Fig. 1.

## 3.3. In vivo PET imaging in normal healthy cynomolgus monkeys

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[66, 766, 495, 845]]<|/det|>
In vivo PET imaging with  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab was performed with tracer only, or carrier-added (1 and 3 mg/kg of nivolumab) in cynomolgus monkeys at multiple time-points. Maximum intensity projections are shown in Fig. 2. Since nivolumab has no PD-1 cross-reactivity in rodents, primates were selected as the pre-clinical imaging model. \( ^{34} \)

PET derived images of NHPs (Fig. 3), revealed that distribution of radioactivity into the spleen was reduced by the addition of unlabeled nivolumab compared to tracer only studies at all imaging time points ( \( -82.5 \pm 4.6\% \) ; range:  \( -75.2 \)  to  \( -87.0\% \) , Table 2). Due to the small number of test animals, statistical data could not be provided. The PK for the two pre-dosed NHPs are reported in Table 3. In the PK analysis, the concentration of nivolumab in carrier-added of 1 mg/kg is  \( 18.9 \mu g/mL \)  at 0.25 h after infusion, more detailed data is shown in Tables 2 and 3. Bone uptake of  \( {}^{89} \) Zr was observed, due to liberation of  \( {}^{89} \) Zr from the DFO chelator, a known effect. There are a growing number of publications exploring more robust chelators to avoid this problem. \( {}^{35,36} \)

This is the first labeling of nivolumab with  \( {}^{89} \) Zr for imaging with co-registered PET/MRI imaging to evaluate the specific binding and biodistribution of nivolumab in vivo with healthy NHPs. Despite a small number of animals, the results from this study show that splenic uptake of  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab is markedly influenced by co-administration of nivolumab in a carrier-added setting. This finding suggests that the  \( {}^{89} \) Zr-nivolumab uptake in the spleen is mediated by specific binding of nivolumab to dendritic cells traversing the spleen. Uptake in the liver is consistent with the expected clearance mechanism of anti-PD-1 mAb with no uptake changes noted in carrier-added studies.

The average percent change in the spleen (Table 2, -82.5 ± 4.6%) matched well with PD-1 receptor occupancy on circulating CD3⁺ T-cells after single infusion. As reported by Brahmer and co-workers, the mean PD-1 occupancies were 85% (70–97%) at peak, and 72% (59–81%) at plateau in humans.³⁷ In the NHP dosed with tracer only, ⁸⁹Zr-nivolumab uptake in the lymph nodes increased over time. This is attributed to labeled nivolumab binding to circulating CD8⁺ T-cells and other lymphocytes, which is consistent with results published by Wang and co-workers in NHPs.¹⁹ Biodistribution of ⁸⁹Zr-nivolumab in other tissues was relatively low with uptake unaffected by the addition of 1 or 3 mg/kg of unlabeled nivolumab. Measured intensities in these tissues show monotonic decrease over time consistent with nonspecific tracer distribution and clearance.
