The Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) protein is an immunoinhibitory receptor expressed by activated cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) that seek out and destroy cancer cells. Multiple cancer types express and upregulate the Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2) which bind to PD-1 as an immune escape mechanism. Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) approved for treatment of multiple cancer types. This study reports the preparation and in vivo evaluation of  \\( ^{89} \\) Zr labeled nivolumab in healthy non-human primates (NHP) as a preliminary study of biodistribution and clearance. The radiochemical and in vivo stabilities of the  \\( ^{89} \\) Zr complex were shown to be acceptable for imaging. Three naïve NHPs were intravenously injected with tracer only or tracer co-injected with nivolumab followed by co-registered by positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), acquired for eight days following injection. Image-derived standardized uptake values (SUV) were quantified by region of interest (ROI) analysis. Radioactivity in the spleen was significantly reduced by addition of excess nivolumab compared to the tracer only study at all imaging time points. Liver uptake of the radiotracer was consistent as a clearance organ with minimal signal from other tissues: lung, muscle, brain, heart, and kidney. The results indicate specific biodistribution to the spleen, which can be blocked by co-administration of excess nivolumab. Distribution to other organs is consistent with elimination pathways of antibodies, with primary clearance through the liver.\n\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[710, 638, 942, 651]]<|/det|>\n© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\n\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[66, 743, 496, 850], [516, 717, 944, 796]]<|/det|>\nThe standard of care for many cancers includes combinations of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical resection when possible. However, each of these treatments can have undesirable side effects that can impact a patient's quality of life. Cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments are intended to disproportionately kill cancer cells, but can have off-target effects with the host's immune system including changes in composition, phenotype, and function of immune cells. \\( ^{1} \\)  As an alternative, cancer immunotherapy utilizes the immune system to identify cancer cells and stimulate the host's immune response to treat the cancer. \\( ^{2} \\)  This includes monoclonal antibody (mAb) based therapies that have recently gained rapid clinical success and often with milder side effects. \\( ^{3} \\)  Understanding T-cell activation and regulation are key to developing successful mAb immunotherapy.\n\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[516, 796, 945, 903]]<|/det|>\nWhen T-cells recognize cancer antigens, they activate a population of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) that seek out and destroy cancer cells. As part of this process, CTLs upregulate expression of the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) protein on their surface. \\( ^{4} \\)  PD-1 is a negative regulatory molecule expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes that can bind to its natural ligands Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2) on neighboring cells as an immune system checkpoint, thus resulting in negative regulation.",

The volume was then diluted with 0.5 mL of 0.5 M HEPES buffer (pH 7.2). To this solution, nivolumab-DFO was added (0.5 mL of 1.5 mg/mL, 750  \\( \\mu \\) g) then an additional 0.2 mL HEPES to bring the volume to 1.8 mL, gently mixed, and held at room temperature for 1 h. Due to the nature of  \\( {}^{89} \\) Zr production, reagent volumes are optimized from the received volume of  \\( {}^{89} \\) Zr-oxalic acid.\n\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[515, 174, 947, 413]]<|/det|>\nThe reaction was transferred to a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with PBS buffer prior to loading of sample and eluted with PBS buffer. A void volume of 0.7 mL was discarded followed by the collection of four fractions of 1–1.5 mL based on radioactive counts eluting from the column. Generally the first 1 mL fraction contained minimal radioactivity followed by a 1.5 mL fraction with the majority of purified  \\( {}^{89} \\) Zr-nivolumab that would be used in imaging. Two additional fractions of 1 and 1.5 mL were collected and determined to contain additional  \\( {}^{89} \\) Zr-nivolumab and other radioactive components. The radioactive counts were monitored during fraction collection to optimize purity of  \\( {}^{89} \\) Zr-nivolumab. Radioactivity of each fraction was recorded and the purity determined by SEC (10/300 GL Superdex 200, PBS buffer mobile phase) with specific activity calculated from NanoDrop protein concentration.

Each NHP underwent a radiotracer only (tracer only), or radiotracer with carrier-added (1 or 3 mg/kg of nivolumab) imaging study. On day 0, following a  \\( \\sim12 \\)  h fast, the NHPs were sedated with an intramuscular injection of ketamine to allow placement of a cephalic indwelling intravenous (IV) catheter for administration of dose of 0, 1 or 3 mg/kg nivolumab. On days 1, 4, 6 and 8, when co-registered PET and MRI studies were performed, anesthesia was induced with an intramuscular combination injection of 0.02 mg/kg atropine, 5 mg/kg ketamine, and 0.01 mg/kg buprenorphine. The NHPs were then maintained on 0.5–2% isoflurane inhalant with 100% oxygen at 1–2 L/min and vacuum scavenging. Once anesthetized, each NHP was placed in a tubular plastic imaging bed to maintain positioning between the PET and MRI during system transfer and to provide precise anatomical alignment. If necessary, ventilator tidal volume was utilized at 10–20 mL/kg for the procedure to maintain sufficient  \\( EtCO_{2} \\)  levels. Every 15 min the NHPs'  \\( SpO_{2} \\) ,  \\( EtCO_{2} \\) , body temperature, respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR) were recorded. In addition, Lactated Ringer's Solution was provided as a constant rate infusion via an indwelling IV catheter during the procedure at approximately 10 mL/kg/hr until the conclusion of imaging.

Maximum intensity projections are shown in Fig. 2. Since nivolumab has no PD-1 cross-reactivity in rodents, primates were selected as the pre-clinical imaging model. \\( ^{34} \\) \n\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[66, 845, 496, 952], [515, 569, 945, 622]]<|/det|>\nPET derived images of NHPs (Fig. 3), revealed that distribution of radioactivity into the spleen was reduced by the addition of unlabeled nivolumab compared to tracer only studies at all imaging time points ( \\( -82.5 \\pm 4.6\\% \\) ; range:  \\( -75.2 \\)  to  \\( -87.0\\% \\) , Table 2). Due to the small number of test animals, statistical data could not be provided. The PK for the two pre-dosed NHPs are reported in Table 3. In the PK analysis, the concentration of nivolumab in carrier-added of 1 mg/kg is  \\( 18.9 \\mu g/mL \\)  at 0.25 h after infusion, more detailed data is shown in Tables 2 and 3. Bone uptake of  \\( {}^{89} \\) Zr was observed, due to liberation of  \\( {}^{89} \\) Zr from the DFO chelator, a known effect. There are a growing number of publications exploring more robust chelators to avoid this problem. \\( {}^{35,36} \\) \n\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[515, 622, 946, 766]]<|/det|>\nThis is the first labeling of nivolumab with  \\( {}^{89} \\) Zr for imaging with co-registered PET/MRI imaging to evaluate the specific binding and biodistribution of nivolumab in vivo with healthy NHPs. Despite a small number of animals, the results from this study show that splenic uptake of  \\( {}^{89} \\) Zr-nivolumab is markedly influenced by co-administration of nivolumab in a carrier-added setting. This finding suggests that the  \\( {}^{89} \\) Zr-nivolumab uptake in the spleen is mediated by specific binding of nivolumab to dendritic cells traversing the spleen. Uptake in the liver is consistent with the expected clearance mechanism of anti-PD-1 mAb with no uptake changes noted in carrier-added studies.\n\n<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[515, 767, 946, 952]]<|/det|>\nThe average percent change in the spleen (Table 2, -82.5 ± 4.6%) matched well with PD-1 receptor occupancy on circulating CD3⁺ T-cells after single infusion. As reported by Brahmer and co-workers, the mean PD-1 occupancies were 85% (70–97%) at peak, and 72% (59–81%) at plateau in humans.³⁷ In the NHP dosed with tracer only, ⁸⁹Zr-nivolumab uptake in the lymph nodes increased over time. This is attributed to labeled nivolumab binding to circulating CD8⁺ T-cells and other lymphocytes, which is consistent with results published by Wang and co-workers in NHPs.¹⁹ Biodistribution of ⁸⁹Zr-nivolumab in other tissues was relatively low with uptake unaffected by the addition of 1 or 3 mg/kg of unlabeled nivolumab. Measured intensities in these tissues show monotonic decrease over time consistent with nonspecific tracer distribution and clearance.",
