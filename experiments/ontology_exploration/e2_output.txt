PROV Ontology Exploration Notes
================================

Structure Overview:
- Total triples: 1664
- Named classes: 51
- Properties: 69 (60 object properties, 9 datatype properties)
- Main namespace: http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#

Core Class Architecture:
The ontology is built around three fundamental classes:
1. Activity - Things that occur over time and act on/with entities
2. Agent - Things that bear responsibility (Person, Organization, SoftwareAgent)
3. Entity - Physical, digital, conceptual things

Specialized Entity Types:
- Collection: Entities that are collections of other entities
- Bundle: Named sets of provenance descriptions
- Dictionary: Collections with key-entity pairs
- Plan: Entities representing intended/prescribed procedures

Influence Pattern:
The ontology uses a sophisticated "Influence" pattern for qualified relations:
- Influence (base class)
  - ActivityInfluence (Communication, Generation, Invalidation, Usage, Start, End)
  - AgentInfluence (Association, Attribution, Delegation)
  - EntityInfluence (Derivation, Quotation, PrimarySource, Revision)

This allows simple binary relations (e.g., wasAttributedTo) to be "qualified" with additional context through qualification classes (e.g., qualifiedAttribution -> Attribution).

Key Property Patterns:
1. Direct relations: wasGeneratedBy, used, wasAttributedTo, actedOnBehalfOf
2. Qualified relations: qualifiedGeneration, qualifiedUsage, qualifiedAttribution, qualifiedAssociation
3. Temporal properties: startedAtTime, endedAtTime, generatedAtTime, invalidatedAtTime
4. Derivation chain: wasDerivedFrom, hadPrimarySource, wasQuotedFrom, wasRevisionOf

Class Hierarchy Observations:
- Activity specializations for contribution tracking (Create, Modify, Publish, Submit)
- Role-based agent classifications (Creator, Contributor, Publisher, RightsHolder)
- Event types all extend InstantaneousEvent (Start, End, Generation, Invalidation)
- Dictionary operations modeled as entities (Insertion, Removal)

Namespace Integration:
The ontology imports/references multiple W3C standards (owl, rdfs, rdf, xsd) and includes cross-references to PROV documentation and related vocabularies.

=== DOMAIN SUMMARY ===

# W3C PROV Ontology - Domain Summary

The W3C PROV (Provenance Ontology) is designed to represent and interchange provenance information across systems and applications. It addresses the fundamental problem of tracking the origins, derivations, and transformations of digital entities—essentially answering "where did this come from?" and "who is responsible for it?" This is critical for domains requiring trust, reproducibility, and accountability, such as scientific data analysis, regulatory compliance, digital publishing, and data quality assessment.

The ontology employs a **core triangular pattern** connecting three fundamental concepts: **Entities** (things with fixed states), **Activities** (processes that use and generate entities), and **Agents** (responsible parties like people, organizations, or software). Entities are generated by activities (`wasGeneratedBy`), activities use entities (`used`), and entities are attributed to agents (`wasAttributedTo`). This creates provenance chains through derivation relationships (`wasDerivedFrom`) that trace data lineage across multiple transformation steps.

PROV implements a **qualification pattern** for expressing detailed contextual information about relationships. Simple properties like `wasAttributedTo` can be elaborated through qualified forms (`qualifiedAttribution`) that link to intermediate qualification classes (Attribution, Association, Derivation, etc.), all inheriting from the root `Influence` class. This dual-level approach allows users to express basic provenance simply while supporting complex scenarios requiring additional metadata such as roles, plans, time bounds, and delegation chains. The ontology also provides specialized structures for collections and bundles, enabling provenance of aggregated datasets and provenance-of-provenance scenarios.
