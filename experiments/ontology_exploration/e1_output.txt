=== DOMAIN SUMMARY ===

# PROV Ontology Domain Summary

## Domain Overview
The PROV ontology represents the **provenance domain** - the systematic tracking and documentation of the origins, history, and lineage of digital and physical resources. It provides a standardized vocabulary for describing how entities came into existence, what activities produced or modified them, and which agents (people, organizations, or software) were responsible for these actions. This ontology is the W3C standard for expressing provenance information across various domains including scientific workflows, data management, digital preservation, and accountability systems.

## Core Concepts and Relationships
The ontology is built around three fundamental classes that form an interconnected provenance model: **Entity** (things or resources whose provenance is tracked), **Activity** (actions that occur over time and act upon entities), and **Agent** (responsible parties - people, organizations, or software). These are linked through influence relationships: entities are generated by activities (`generated`), activities use entities (`used`), and agents are associated with activities (`wasAssociatedWith`) or attributed to entities (`wasAttributedTo`). Specialized concepts extend this core model, including **Derivation** (how entities transform into others), **Association** and **Delegation** (responsibility chains between agents), and structured data types like **Collection** and **Dictionary** for representing composite entities.

## Primary Use Cases
The PROV ontology serves multiple critical functions: enabling **reproducibility** in scientific research by documenting data processing workflows, supporting **audit trails** for regulatory compliance, facilitating **trust assessment** by revealing resource origins and transformations, and enabling **attribution** of creative works to their creators and contributors. Specific activity types like `Create`, `Modify`, `Publish`, and `Accept` support scholarly communication workflows, while the Bundle concept allows for "provenance of provenance" - essential for tracking the reliability of provenance records themselves across distributed systems.
