The definition property may vary by ontology:\n   - For PROV ontology: use `prov:definition`\n   - For other ontologies: check for `rdfs:comment`, `skos:definition`, or similar properties\n\n4. **SPARQL pattern**:\n   ```sparql\n   PREFIX [namespace]: <[namespace_uri]>\n   PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n   \n   SELECT ?label ?definition\n   WHERE {\n     [namespace]:[ClassName] rdfs:label ?label .\n     [namespace]:[ClassName] [definition_property] ?definition .\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Formulate answer**: Combine the label and definition to create a natural language answer stating what the class is and its purpose/meaning\n\nThis approach works for definitional questions about ontology classes where both human-readable labels and formal definitions are available as RDF properties.", "src": "success", "tags": []}, {"id": "57df3d43bb04", "title": "Finding Class Properties via rdfs:domain Pattern", "desc": "Strategy for: What properties does Activity have?", "content": "To find all properties associated with a specific class in an RDF graph:\n\n1. **Identify the target class URI**: Determine the full URI of the class you're investigating (e.g., `prov:Activity` maps to `http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Activity`).\n\n2. **Query using rdfs:domain pattern**: Use a SPARQL query that selects properties where the class is specified as the domain:\n   ```sparql\n   SELECT DISTINCT ?property WHERE {\n     ?property rdfs:domain <ClassURI> .\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Key pattern elements**:\n   - Use `rdfs:domain` predicate to find properties that have the target class as their domain\n   - The `?property` variable will bind to all property URIs that can be used with instances of the class\n   - `DISTINCT` ensures no duplicate properties are returned\n\n4. **Extract property names**: Parse the returned URIs to extract the local names (the part after `#` or the final `/`) for a human-readable list.\n\n5. **Format the answer**: Present the count and enumerated list of property names extracted from the URIs.\n\nThis pattern works because RDF Schema uses `rdfs:domain` to formally declare which class a property applies to, making it the standard way to discover class-property relationships in ontologies.", "src": "success", "tags": []}, {"id": "436aa619198d", "title": "Finding Direct Subclasses Using rdfs:subClassOf Pattern", "desc": "Strategy for: What are the subclasses of Entity?", "content": "To find direct subclasses of a specific class in an RDF graph:\n\n1. **Identify the target class**: Determine the full URI of the class whose subclasses you want to find (e.g., prov:Entity with URI http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#)\n\n2. **Use the rdfs:subClassOf property pattern**: Query for resources that have an rdfs:subClassOf relationship pointing to the target class:\n   - Pattern: `?subclass rdfs:subClassOf <TargetClass>`\n   - This finds all classes that are declared as direct subclasses\n\n3. **Declare necessary prefixes**: Include the PREFIX declarations for:\n   - The namespace of the target class (e.g., prov:)\n   - The RDFS namespace for the subClassOf property: `PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>`\n\n4. **Structure the query**: Use a simple SELECT query with the triple pattern in the WHERE clause:\n   ```sparql\n   SELECT ?subclass\n   WHERE {\n       ?subclass rdfs:subClassOf <TargetClass> .\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Extract results**: The query returns URIs of all direct subclasses, which can be converted to human-readable names by extracting the local part of each URI\n\nThis pattern works for any class hierarchy query where you need to find immediate children in the class taxonomy.", "src": "success", "tags": []}]
