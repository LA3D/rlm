# Eval Task: PROV Activity Hierarchy
# Category: Hierarchy Navigation
# Difficulty: Medium

task:
  id: "prov_activity_subclasses_001"
  category: "hierarchy"
  difficulty: "medium"

  # Input
  query: "What are the subclasses and superclasses of prov:Activity?"

  context:
    ontologies:
      - name: prov
        source: ontology/prov.ttl

  # Success Criteria
  graders:
    - type: groundedness
      required_evidence:
        - pattern: "Activity"
      min_groundedness_score: 0.5

    - type: convergence

        - function: "probe_relationships|describe_entity"
          contains: "subclass"

  # Trial Configuration
  trials: 5

# Notes:
# - Tests ability to navigate class hierarchy
# - Should use probe_relationships() or SPARQL for hierarchy
# - Must explore both up (superclasses) and down (subclasses)
