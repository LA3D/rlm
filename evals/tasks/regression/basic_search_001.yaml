# Eval Task: Basic Search Functionality
# Category: Regression
# Difficulty: Trivial (must pass 100%)

task:
  id: "basic_search_001"
  category: "regression"
  difficulty: "trivial"

  # Input
  query: "Search for 'Activity' in the PROV ontology and tell me what you find."

  context:
    ontologies:
      - name: prov
        source: ontology/prov.ttl

  # Success Criteria - MUST ALL PASS
  graders:
    - type: tool_called
      required:
        - search_entity

    - type: convergence
      max_iterations: 3

    - type: groundedness
      min_groundedness_score: 0.3

  # Trial Configuration
  trials: 3
  pass_threshold: 1.0  # All trials must pass

# Notes:
# - This is a regression test - must maintain 100% pass rate
# - Tests that basic search_entity() functionality works
# - Very low iteration limit - should be fast
