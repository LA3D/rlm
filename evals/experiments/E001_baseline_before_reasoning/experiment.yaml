# Experiment E001: Baseline Before Reasoning Fields

experiment:
  id: "E001"
  name: "baseline_before_reasoning"

  # What are you testing?
  hypothesis: |
    Establish baseline performance metrics before implementing Think-Act-Verify-Reflect
    reasoning cycles. This baseline will be used to measure the impact of structured
    reasoning fields on evidence quality and pass rate.

    summary: |
      Baseline measurements before Think-Act-Verify-Reflect implementation:

      - bacteria_taxa: 58.6% pass rate (17/29 trials), 8.9 avg iterations
      - ecoli_k12: 0.0% pass rate (0/6 trials), 11.0 avg iterations
      - basic_search: 0.0% pass rate (0/4 trials), failed to run

      KEY FINDING: E. coli K12 task showed systematic evidence format issues.
      Agent stored metadata (sequence_length) instead of actual data (amino acid sequences).
      This indicated need for explicit verification step before SUBMIT.

    next_steps: |
      → E002: Implement Rung 1 of Think-Act-Verify-Reflect plan

      Add thinking/verification/reflection fields to QueryConstructionSig to:
      1. Address evidence format issues
      2. Improve pass rate on E. coli K12 task
      3. Establish structured reasoning pattern

      Target: >50% pass rate on E. coli K12, evidence includes actual sequences

# Detailed findings
findings:
  bacteria_taxa:
    pass_rate: 0.586
    passed_trials: 17
    total_trials: 29
    avg_iterations: 8.9
    notes: "Moderate success, but inconsistent evidence quality"

  ecoli_k12:
    pass_rate: 0.0
    passed_trials: 0
    total_trials: 6
    avg_iterations: 11.0
    notes: |
      Complete failure mode. Evidence format issues: agent stored sequence_length
      instead of actual amino acid sequences. No verification step to catch this
      before SUBMIT.

  basic_search:
    pass_rate: 0.0
    passed_trials: 0
    total_trials: 4
    avg_iterations: 0.0
    notes: "Failed to execute (unrelated to reasoning fields)"
