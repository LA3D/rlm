So I’m interested in looking at understanding this RML paper and
potentially thinking through how this sort of approach might be
implemented in Solveit using some of the Solveit tools that are already
available. So could you have a think through this RML paper and in
particular the ability for a model to manage its own content text? For
reference, the source code for this publication is in the rmlpaper
directory that you may look at.
