    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Core RLM Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The RLM approach says: **don't feed huge contexts directly into the LLM's attention mechanism**. Instead, store the data externally and let the LLM use Python tools to inspect, slice, search, and transform it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How inspecttools Fits\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dialoghelper.inspecttools` functions are essentially implementations of this pattern for **Python objects in memory**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tool | RLM Purpose |\n",
    "|------|------------|\n",
    "| `symlen(sym)` | Check size *before* loading — avoid dumping 10,000 lines if you only need 50 |\n",
    "| `symslice(sym, start, end)` | Extract just a portion — classic chunking |\n",
    "| `symsrc(sym)` | Get source only when needed |\n",
    "| `getdir(sym)` | See what's available without loading everything |\n",
    "| `getval(sym)` | Peek at a value |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concrete Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have a 500-function module. Traditional approach:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bad: dumps everything into context\n",
    "print(inspect.getsource(huge_module))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "RLM approach with inspecttools:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. What's there?\n",
    "getdir(\"huge_module\", exclude_private=True)  # → ['func_a', 'func_b', ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. How big is the thing I care about?\n",

    "# 3. Only now load what I need\n",

    "1. `ont_load()` ran successfully and returned an `AttrDict`\n",
    "2. But the result wasn't stored as a persistent symbol I could navigate\n",
    "3. `_last` didn't work reliably for accessing the nested structure\n",

    "- `rg` output went directly into my attention window — the opposite of progressive disclosure\n",

    "sio = ont_load(\"ontology/sio/sio-release.owl\")\n",

    "- The REPL injects `llm_query` into `globals` so code can call it\n",
    "- It's a **synchronous call** — the agent's code pauses, queries an LLM, gets response back\n",
    "- Also has `llm_query_batched()` for parallel queries\n",

    "So most of this actually is in the ontology, except you don't have any sort of instructions on how to notice these things and create your own index structure. So the LLM needs a little bit of sensible guidance. So think about this in terms of something like progressive disclosure and hierarchical RAG, so that you have some index and then through a genetic retrieval you can go and find additional context, but you don't have to load the whole thing at once. I think noting that these things exist in the ontology when you essentially create a sense of the ontology. So what we're really trying to do here is just like a human would read through an ontology and get a sense of its formalism, its structure, its metadata, all these sorts of things. When we load an ontology, the LM essentially needs to do that same sort of thing, but create a document that is in its context that it can dynamically retrieve to remind itself of essentially that sense of the ontology. \n",

Could you do a little bit of research and see what might make sense for how to do this? I mean we essentially want a workflow rather than agentic tool use, but that workflow may require agents with tool use. So we need to sort of think about that a little bit about what this agentic loop is going to need in order to create the sense documents, and then what the appropriate way using RLM is to store that information in essentially retrievable objects. \n",

    "   - Aggregate findings\n",

    "4. **Phase 4: Sense synthesis** (sub-LLM)\n",
    "   - `llm_query` to synthesize accumulated observations into structured sense document\n",

      "## SIO Ontology Structure Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my exploration of the SIO (Semanticscience Integrated Ontology), here's what I've learned about its structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overall Statistics\n",
      "- **Classes**: 1,726 classes\n",
      "- **Properties**: 211 properties  \n",
      "- **Individuals**: 0 individuals\n",
      "- **Labels**: 1,796 labels\n",
      "- **Root Classes**: 3 top-level root classes\n",
      "\n",
      "### Metadata\n",
      "- **Prefixes**: 33 namespace prefixes\n",
      "- **Annotation Predicates**: 35 annotation predicates\n",
      "- **Imports**: No external ontology imports (self-contained)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Top-Level Conceptual Organization\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my searches, SIO appears to be organized around several fundamental categories:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Core Top-Level Concepts Found:**\n",
      "1. **Entity** - The fundamental class for things that exist\n",
      "2. **Object** - Physical and abstract objects\n",
      "3. **Process** - Activities and transformations\n",
      "4. **Attribute** - Characteristics and properties (with subclasses like quality, role, capability)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Major Domain Areas Covered:**\n",
      "- **Material/Chemical Domain**: 28+ chemical-related concepts, including molecules and proteins\n",
      "- **Information Domain**: 8+ information-related concepts including collections\n",
      "- **Physical Objects**: Devices, organisms, and material entities\n",
      "- **Qualities and Attributes**: Roles, qualities, and capabilities that describe entities\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Characteristics\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: With 1,726 classes, SIO provides extensive coverage of scientific concepts, particularly in the life sciences and chemistry domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Well-Documented**: The 1,796 labels (more than the number of classes) suggest rich annotation with synonyms and alternative labels.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Self-Contained Design**: No external imports means SIO is designed as a standalone, comprehensive ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clean Hierarchy**: Only 3 root classes indicates a well-organized top-level structure, likely following a philosophical foundation (similar to BFO - Basic Formal Ontology patterns).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Rich Property Model**: 211 properties provide extensive relationship modeling capabilities between entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Domain Focus**: Strong emphasis on scientific domains including chemistry, biology, and information science, making it suitable for semantic integration in scientific data applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ontology appears to follow a foundational approach where all concepts are organized under a small number of fundamental categories (entity, object, process, attribute), with extensive specialization for scientific and biomedical domains.\n"

    "So, So I think the idea behind our LLM is that we want to do some things programmatically. So if we can accomplish a task without an agentic approach, so say storing results in the REPL automatically, my feeling is that we probably want to do that. And if we minimize the number of tools that the underlying system has to use in order to accomplish the task. So if some of these things are less agentic and more of just a workflow with LLM calls, I think that that may in fact be as effective as the agentic approach. So I'd like to think through where we have to use the agentic approach and then think through places where we can get away with just using an LLM call instead. The places where we need an agentic approach is where we need agentic decision-making and agentic behavior, as versus an LLM call which is just doing some task that may be fixed. \n",

    "Okay, I want to take a little bit of a break here. So now that we have something of a working prototype, I'd like to think through how to actually structure this in an nbdev project. So I think that what I'd like is the core to be the abstractions that I need in order to do the general RLM method that aren't necessarily provided by dialoghelper. So we had to create a few extra bonus bits here that we needed to do the implementation for the ontology and SPARQL functionality. And then I think that the second notebook should be the ontology and SPARQL functionality that leverages the core RLM. So given that you just identified some missing pieces of the core that we need to implement, could you think through what this would look like and what functionalities should go into each notebook? \n",
